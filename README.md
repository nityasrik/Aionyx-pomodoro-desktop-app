## 🌟 Why I Built This

As a designer-developer passionate about productivity and delightful interfaces, I wanted to craft a Pomodoro app that felt less clinical and more *comforting*. Something with:

- Personality (hello, little focus buddy!)
- Functional beauty (bento layout, task tracking, analytics)
- Aesthetic charm (pixel fonts, pastel modes, animated touches)

This is my take on **"cozy tech meets clever tools."**
